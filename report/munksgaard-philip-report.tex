\section*{Programming Part}

\subsection*{Description of the Implementation}

First of all, I have decided to move the provided classes and
interfaces, as well as any classes I've made, into appropriate
subfolders and -packages, so as to provide for a cleaner, less
clutterede system organization.

\subsection*{Question 1}

%% Overall implementation of OrderManager and ItemSupplier, including
%% the following:

%% - Considering your use of logging, what RPC semantics are
%% effectively implemented between clients and OrderManager or
%% ItemSupplier? What RPC semantics are effectively implemented
%% between OrderManager and ItemSupplier? Explain.

%% - How did you make workflow processing asynchronous at the
%% OrderManager?

%% - How did you handle failures of individual components? In
%% particular, how do you handle failure propagation?


\subsection*{Question 2}

%% An ItemSupplier executes operations originated at multiple
%% instances of OrderManager as well as local clients. Describe how
%% you ensured atomocity of the operations. Mention the following:

%% Which method did you use to ensure serializability at each item
%% supplier?

%% Argue for the correctness of your method.

%% Argue for the performance of your model.


\subsection*{Question 3}

%% How would you recover from a failure of an OrderManager or an
%% ItemSupplier? For each of the two scenarios, explain necessary
%% interaction with other components to archieve recovery, how you
%% would use the log, why it is sufficient.


\subsection*{Question 4}

%% Describe your high-level strategy to test your
%% implementation. Mention the following:

%% How you tested execution workflows by the OrderManager, considering
%% asynchronicity of execution.

%% How you tested operations were atomic at the ItemSupplier

%% How you tested error conditions and failures of multiple comonents.


\subsection*{Question 5}

%% Design, describe and execute an experiment that shows how your
%% implementation of a single ItemSupplier behaves as concurrency is
%% increased. Mention: Setup, Results. Also figures.
